I reach over and the fruit of life stand still
Stand awhile we search our past we start anew
The music sings of love you knew We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Sands of companions sides that be
The strength of the meeting lies with you
Wait the more regard your past
School gates remind us of our class
Chase confusion away with us
